# 1. pip install phonenumbers
 The phonenumbers library in Python is a powerful tool for parsing, formatting, and validating phone numbers. It is a port of Google's libphonenumber library and provides a wide range of functionalities related to phone number handling. Here are some of the key features and uses of the phonenumbers library
 
 1. Parsing Phone Numbers: You can parse a phone number from a string into a structured format, which includes country code, national number, and more.
 2. Validating Phone Numbers: The library can check if a phone number is valid for a given region.
 3. Formatting Phone Numbers: You can format phone numbers in various styles, such as international, national, or E.164 formats
 4. Getting Metadata: The library provides access to metadata about phone numbers, such as the country of origin, carrier information, and whether the number is a mobile or landline
    
# 2. pip install folium
The folium library in Python is a powerful tool for creating interactive maps using the Leaflet.js library. It allows you to visualize data thatâ€™s been manipulated in Python on an interactive map. Here are some of the key features and uses of the folium library

 1. Creating Interactive Maps: Folium makes it easy to create interactive maps with just a few lines of code. You can specify the location, zoom level, and other parameters.
    import folium
      # Create a map centered at a specific location
      m = folium.Map(location=[45.5236, -122.6750], zoom_start=13)
 2. Adding Markers: You can add markers to the map to indicate specific locations. Markers can include popups and tooltips for additional information.
        folium.Marker(
        location=[45.5236, -122.6750],
        popup='Portland, OR',
        tooltip='Click for more info'
    ).add_to(m)


# 3. pip install opencage
The opencage library in Python is a client for the OpenCage Geocoding API, which provides geocoding and reverse geocoding services. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), while reverse geocoding does the opposite, converting geographic coordinates back into a human-readable address.

 1. Geocoding: Convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). This is useful for applications that need to map addresses or locations.

    from opencage.geocoder import OpenCageGeocode
      key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
      geocoder = OpenCageGeocode(key)
      result = geocoder.geocode('1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA')
      if result:
          print(result[0]['geometry']['lat'], result[0]['geometry']['lng'])
